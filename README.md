# Functionality:

This app is a carousel with three slides, the slides change automatically every 8 seconds. It also has buttons to change the slide.
One button to scroll left and the other to scroll right. If we are in the last slider we will not be able to move further to the right,
And the same if we are in the first slider, they will not be able to move to the left. The position of the slide is preserved with local 
storage, so when you close the application and open it again, the slide will be displayed according to the stored position.
